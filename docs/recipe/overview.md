# Overview

You see from the [tutorial](../start/first_workflow.md) how a workflow looks
like and how it runs. While it is handy to use one the wizards to generate your
workflow, it is often desirable to modify it to suit your specific need.

This part of the documentation hosts detailed documentation of the workflows
generated by the wizard (recipes) and their components (modules), to help you
understand how the workflow in TIPS are designed.
