There are two types of nextflow nextflow scripts in this repository. Modules
contains components for simple tasks, while recipes are complex workflows. The
recipes can be direcly used with `nextflow run main.nf -entry `, while the
modules serve as components for recipes.

This section documents the usage of those modules. Available parameters will be
listed for each module file, and the input/output specification will be listed
for each process or workflow.
