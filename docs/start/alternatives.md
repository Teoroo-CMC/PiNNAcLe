# Alternatives

Below lists known implementations of active atomistic machine learning codes
that shares some purposes with TIPS (benchmarking MLPs or active learning with
MLPs). If you are not sure about TIPS, maybe it will help you to evaluate the
alternatives.

## DP-GEN

DP-GEN is possibly one of the earliest open-source code that automates the
generation of MLPs. The code is mainly tightly integrated with the
DeepPotential, and interfaces to a wide variety of QM packages ([official
site](https://deepmodeling.com/), [github
repo](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpgen))

## MLAtom

MLAtom is interfaced to several third-party AML libraries that allows for the
benchmark of AML methods. ([official site](http://mlatom.com/))

## Atomistic Adversal attack

This is a demo project based on the Neural Force Field (NFF) code, featuring the
active sampling of sampling of molecular geometries with adveral attack. ([github
repo](https://github.com/learningmatter-mit/Atomistic-Adversarial-Attacks))

Composing reusable workflows is a common problem in different branches of
computational sciences. Specifically for atomistic simulations, much effort was
taken to bridge and interface different softwares. Those tools is better
summerized in other lists provied below:
